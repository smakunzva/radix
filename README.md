# Radix
This repository show Radix algorithm sorting implementation. Radix algorithm:

a) Makes assumptions that data has same radix (radix for decimal system is 10 , radix for alphabet is 26, binary 2) and width

b) Sorted from the right most position like the unit, then 10th , then 100th

c) Sorted on each individual letter or digit and data can be integers or strings
